Update Report: Changes and Implementations

1. Refactored Code Structure:
Old: The application previously had all logic embedded within MainWindow.xaml.cs, resulting in a monolithic structure.
New: Introduced separate classes and methods for better organization and maintainability. Added CaptureRecipe, RecipeFilter, and DeleteFunctions classes to encapsulate related functionalities.

2. Event Handling for Calories Exceed:
Old: No explicit handling for notifying when total calories exceed 300.
New: Implemented CaloriesExceedsDelegate and CaloriesExceedsEvent in MainWindow to display a warning message when total calories exceed the limit.

3. Recipe Capture and Storage:
Old: Direct handling of recipe data within event handlers like AddRecipe_Click and AddDetails_Click.
New: Introduced CaptureRecipe class to manage recipe data storage (Names, Instructions, Ingredients, Units, IngredientCalories, IngredientFoodGroups, TotalCalories). Methods like CaptureRecipeInformation now encapsulate the logic for adding, updating, and calculating total calories.

4. Recipe Filtering:
Old: No explicit recipe filtering capability.
New: Added RecipeFilter class with methods FilterRecipes and GetAllRecipes to filter recipes based on name and food group, enhancing the application's search functionality.

5. Improved UI Interaction:
Old: Limited UI updates after data changes, requiring manual refreshes.
New: Implemented RefreshRecipeList method to update RecipeListBox dynamically after adding, updating, or deleting recipes, enhancing user interaction and feedback.

6. Modular Error Handling:
Old: Limited error checking and validation for user inputs.
New: Enhanced input validation in methods like AddRecipe_Click, AddDetails_Click, and UpdateRecipe_Click to ensure numeric inputs for quantities and calories, improving user experience and data integrity.


7. Clearer Separation of Concerns:
Old: Mixed UI logic (event handlers) with data management and manipulation.
New: Separated concerns more clearly by moving data operations into dedicated classes (CaptureRecipe, RecipeFilter, DeleteFunctions), promoting cleaner code architecture and easier future expansions.

8. Enhanced User Feedback:
Old: Limited user feedback on actions like recipe additions, updates, or deletions.
New: Added informative message boxes (MessageBox.Show) to provide feedback on successful operations, errors in inputs, or warnings like exceeding calorie limits, improving usability and user satisfaction.
